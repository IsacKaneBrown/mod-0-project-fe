## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I tend to wait to long to ask questions, which no doudt is caused by pride. Often times I find myself forcing myself to complete a task solo when jolly cooperation would have gone much smoother.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

Number Data Type: Handles numbers including, negatives, and decimals.

String Datat type: letters and other chcaracters wrapped in quotations.

Boolean Data Type: one of two vaules, "true" or "false". Helping the script decide which to run and which line to not run.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

```JavaScript
console.log(`Hello Wolrd!`);
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

`//` forward dash implies anyhting after as unreadable. This allows us to leave small comments over changes/updates made to said line of code. Allows developers to communicate more effectively during a project.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

_Varibales_**: are groups of information that can be assigined a vaule. such as a variable for *age*, containing information on how old someone is.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Instagram:

_Number Data Type_**: how many likes/comments are on a post

_String Data Type_**: usernames/comments/Dms

_Boolean Data Type_**: did user like/heart said post or comment?


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

combines variable types into a string

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

Instagram, *boolean* + *number data type* , to log likes/hearts on a post or comment. Did user like post? if true, log and display number under "likes".

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

Is there a more time effective way to enter long concatenation strings?
