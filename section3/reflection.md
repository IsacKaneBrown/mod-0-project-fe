## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

I felt comfortable, I took my time and really combed over the details. I found I grasped things a tad better when faced with the challenge of self reliance. Though I have a lot to learn, this helped raise my confidence when approaching problems on my own.  

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Instagram when logging and categorizing hashtag's. Such as "fitness" , "Cooking" , or "Memes". each `var`  having subsections such as `var Memes = ["DankMemes", "Funny", "Sarcasm"];`.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array methods are ways developers can interact and change the elements within a variable. Each having a different function for specific tasks. Such as the method `unshift()`, which adds elements to the beginning of an Array.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

The purpose of a loop is to run code over and over, until a specific condition is met. You wouldn't use a loop if you wanted more control in your array.


5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Loops keep going until a rule says they cant. A loop can count to 10 but if i say it cant go past 10, it wont.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

None so far, just need to get more comfortable with them.
