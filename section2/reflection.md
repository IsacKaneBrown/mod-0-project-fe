## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

⋅⋅* By believing in yourself while coding, keeping a healthy mindset, you can develop more mastery and learning oriented behaviors associated with this type of mid set.

⋅⋅* S.M.A.R.T. goals Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goals. Though a simple and easy way to stay on track with goals, it's effectiveness is evident in my own life.


2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

⋅⋅* I demonstrate self confidence in my work and mindset. It keeps me motivated and hungry for successfully completing a task.

⋅⋅* I need to work on my S.M.A.R.T plan. I believe I've lost track and need to ground myself with it again. 

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I feel it helped me gain confidence in my own ability to adapt. Though I moved through section 2 slower than previous sections, but this also made more attentive with my work. Over all, boosted my confidence in my own ability.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

⋅⋅* An Conditional is telling the computer to do _this_ or _that_.

⋅⋅* A daily life example of a conditional could be getting gas if the tank is less than half full. If its over half, you don't need gas.

⋅⋅* Instagram most likely uses one when someone makes a post. When making a post Instagram will ask if you want to post to your story.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

To use multiple 'if' statements you follow in the sequence as follows:

```JavaScript

if (condition) {
  statements1
} else {
  statements2
}
```

The computer would read this as follows, "If 'condition' is false, run and print 'statements2'."




6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

logical Operators; to check if two expressions both evaluate to true , use the 'AND' operator '&&' . To check if at least one of the expressions evaluate to true , use the OR operator '||' .


7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

No questions, just need to keep studying them.
